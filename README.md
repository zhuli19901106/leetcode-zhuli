# leetcode-2
Leetcode revision, premium problems included.
<hr/>

This is a repo containing my <b>accepted codes</b> on Leetcode.

It was originally created as a revision practice repo, to make sure my skills on handling <b>data structure and algorithm problems</b> don't get rusty.

As I've spent quite a bit of time finishing hundreds of problems on it, <b>this repo is now my main repo for Leetcode.</b>

If my code proves useful to you in any way, I'm glad to know that. Feel free to upvote and bookmark my Zhihu article down below. <b>As it'll be updated from time to time.</b>

If you find anything buggy or worth a bit of discussion in my codes, <b>please leave a comment in the corresponding article at my Zhihu article</b>.

Please visit <b>[my Leetcode memo](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25697275)</b> for more information.

<b>Wish you good luck in landing your dream job offer</b> as software engineers/data scientists/research scientists/quantitative researchers/algorithmic traders/blabla.

As long as your job description includes writing codes, you'll have to face this kind of FUBAR sooner or later. <b>So let's get it done.</b>

If there's anything I've learned from the past twenty-or-so years in my life (as a loser, of course), it's <b>"live on and dream on"</b>.

You gotta eat, so you write codes. You gotta dream, so you always have something worth living for. Tell you what, <b>I'm gonna be a musician someday</b>.

向死而生。
